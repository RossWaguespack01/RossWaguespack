<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>
Ross grew up in a small town in Louisiana, where his love for drawing started as soon as he could hold a pencil. He spent his childhood sketching superheroes and creating handmade comic books with his friends — a passion that quickly grew into a lifelong goal.
</p>
<p>
When he's not working on his next creative idea, you can usually find him playing video games, lifting at the gym, or watching anime for inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Ross graduated from Louisiana State University with a degree in 2D Animation and is eager to bring imaginative characters and stories to life. He is currently focused on meeting new people, exploring exciting opportunities, and continually improving his craft as an artist.
